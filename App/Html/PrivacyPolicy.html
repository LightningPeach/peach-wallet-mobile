  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two privacy modes available in the Software: Extended and Standard. In the
      Software, we provide a switch toggle which allows a user to switch between the two modes. The Extended mode
      introduces additional features but requires minimal interaction with Peach servers to work. Standard mode excludes
      any communication with external servers at the expense of the following three features being disabled: Recurring/Stream
      payments, Payments without a user-generated Lightning invoice, and Contacts. The privacy mode can be changed anytime within the
      Profile screen of the Wallet.</span></p>
  <p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">If Standard mode is activated, we do not collect or process any personal information
      about the wallet and its usage. In other words, the Software does not connect or interact with any Peach servers at
      any moment in this mode. A privacy mode choice is offered to a user during the first run of the
      Wallet and is made available as a setting in the Software.</span></p>
  <p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the Extended mode is activated, we process the following personal data:</span></p>
  <ol class="ol2">
    <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Transaction information (sender’s and receiver’s public keys) is transmitted from
        your wallet to the Peach server when a recurring/stream payment or a payment through Lightning_id (public key) is
        initiated (invoice less payments). This data is never stored, and the Peach server only routes this data to the
        payment recipient. The transaction is end-to-end encrypted on the wallet side and the Peach server does not
        have access to any data except from where from and where to the payment needs to be routed.</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Your IP address, which we automatically receive and record when you interact with our
        server, is only kept for the duration the wallet is online and Standard mode is switched off.</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s1">Lightning_id known as the Public key of your wallet (unique identifier of
        lightning node in the lightning network in hex representation), </span><span class="s2">is received by the Peach
        server only when the wallet user interacts with one of the three additional features of the Extended mode (see paragraph 1). This
        data is only</span><span class="s1"> kept for the duration the wallet is online and Standard mode is switched
        off.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s1">The information above is collected with the sole purpose of allowing the Extended mode
      functionality to the user.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s1">By clicking the optional consent button, you allow collecting anonymized usage
      statistics via Google Analytics and Firebase. Please note, that we collect this data even in Standard mode but only
      if you have explicitly opted in for us to do so during the Wallet setup. This process does not interact with our servers and does not provide any personal data. The information we
      process here is fully anonymized and could not be used to track down a particular person or device.</span></p>
  <p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">We do </span><span class="s3">NOT</span><span class="s1"> collect, nor have access to,

  <p class="p9"><span class="s1">When you provide the IP address and Public Key, we process them to only route recurring/stream
      payments, and payments via ligthning_id (public key) that are initiated by the sender without a corresponding
      recipient payment request. Transaction information is only used to route messages between wallet users if there is
      no payment request from the recipient. If the recipient does send a payment request, the Peach server does not even
      participate in this exchange at all, and no information is shared.</span></p>

  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Providing the required data (IP and Lightning ID) is necessary for you to use some
      features of the Software. If you do not wish to provide the required data, you may not be able to use some functions of
      the Software (i.e. recurring/stream payments). When you use the Software, and provide the data, you can contact us (please
      see paragraph 11 below) to exercise any of the rights you are granted under applicable data protection laws, which
      includes (1) the right to access your data, (2) to rectify them, (3) to erase them, (4) to restrict the processing
      of your data, (5) the right to receiving a file of your personal data and (6) or the right to object to the
      processing, and where we have asked for your consent, to withdraw this consent (consent can be withdrawn anytime
      from the in-app Profile screen by setting Standard mode). These rights may be limited in some situations. We may,
      for example, deny your request for access when necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of other individuals or
      refuse to delete your personal data in case the processing of such data is necessary for compliance with legal
      obligations. The right to data portability, for example, does not apply in case the personal data was not provided
      by you or if we process the data not on the basis of your consent or for the performance of a contract.</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you would like to exercise your rights, please send your request to the contact
      details in Paragraph 11 below. Please note that we may need you to provide additional information to confirm your
      identity. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Dutch Data Protection Authority or the supervisory
      authority in the EU member state of your permanent residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of your
      rights regarding your personal data.</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s3">1. Right to access</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may ask us whether or not we process any of your personal data and, if so, receive
      access to that data in the form of a copy. When complying with an access request, we will also provide you with
      additional information, such as the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned as well as
      any other information necessary for you to exercise the essence of this right.<span
        class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s3">2. Right to rectification</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have the right to have your data rectified in case of inaccuracy or incompleteness.
      Upon request, we correct inaccurate personal data about you and, taking into account the purposes of the
      processing, complete incomplete personal data, which may include the provision of a supplementary statement.<span
        class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s3">3. Right to erasure</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You also have the right to have your personal data erased, which means the deletion of
      your data by us and, where possible, any other controller to whom your data has previously been made public by
      us. Erasure of your personal data only finds place in certain cases,
      prescribed by law and listed under article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes
      situations where your personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the initial purposes for which they were
      processed as well as situations where they were processed unlawfully. Due to the way we maintain certain services,
      it may take some time before backup copies are erased.</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s3">4. Right to restriction of processing</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have the right to obtain the restriction of the processing of your personal data,
      which means that we suspend the processing of your data for a certain period of time. Circumstances which may give
      rise to this right include situations where the accuracy of your personal data was contested but some time is needed
      for us to verify their accuracy. This right does not prevent us from continue storing your personal data. We
      will inform you before the restriction is lifted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s3">5. Right to receive a file (data portability)</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your right to data portability entails that you may request us to provide you with your
      personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to have such data transmitted directly
      to another controller, where technically feasible. Upon request and where this is technically feasible, we transmit your personal data directly to the other controller.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s3">6. Right to object</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data, which means
      you may request us to no longer process your personal data. This only applies in case the ‘legitimate interests’
      ground constitutes the legal basis for processing (see par. ‘Legal basis’ above).</span></p>
  <p class="p1"><span class="s1">At any time and free of charge you can object to direct marketing communications. This applies in case your
      personal data are processed for such purpose, which also includes profiling to the extent that it is related to
      such direct marketing. If you exercise this right, we will no longer process your personal data for such
      purpose.</span></p>
